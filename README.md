# ConstraintLayout Demo
> NOTE: This is in planning phase now.

A demo application for Android ConstraintLayout with various usage with sample code.

## Proposed Features
* Have a grid containing different feature set of `ConstraintLayout`
* For each feature, have different examples
* Each example should allow you to share the code snippet or copy to clipboard
* Each example may also contain additional resource links to blog or technical articals


## Objective
These are the my objectives for this demo application.
* To explore all the features of constrainst layout
* Use material design component in the sample app
* Use the new architecture components in the sample app
* Use proper architecture for the app - likely MVVM
* Document everything well so that future external contribution is easier

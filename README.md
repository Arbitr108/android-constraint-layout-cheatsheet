## :bookmark: Official Demo
Google has official demo project that contains a list of layouts that showcases the various features and usage of
[ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/constraint/ConstraintLayout.html) and 
[MotionLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/constraint/motion/MotionLayout)

See https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ConstraintLayoutExamples

## Proposed App Features
* Have a grid containing different feature set of `ConstraintLayout`
* For each feature, have different examples
* Each example should allow you to share the code snippet or copy to clipboard
* Each example may also contain additional resource links to blog or technical articles
* Example may have set of sliders/toggle to change metrics dynamically to visualize.


### `ConstraintLayout` features to cover 
- [ ] Relative positioning
  * [ ] Horizontal Axis: left, right, start and end sides
  * [ ] Vertical Axis: top, bottom sides and text baseline
- [ ] Margins
- [x] Centering positioning and bias
- [x] Circular positioning _(Added in 1.1)_
- [x] Visibility behavior
- [ ] Dimension constraints
  * [x] Ratio
  * [x] Percent dimension
  * [x] Min and Max
  * [ ] `MATCH_CONSTRAINT` dimensions _(Added in 1.1)_
  * [ ] `WRAP_CONTENT` : enforcing constraints _(Added in 1.1)_
  * [ ] Widgets dimension constraints
- [ ] Chains

  * [x] Weighted chains
  * [ ] Margins and chains _(Added in 1.1)_
- [x] Virtual Helpers objects ðŸ¥‡
  * [x] Guideline
  * [x] Barrier
  * [x] Group
- [ ] Optimizer _(Added in 1.1)_

## Objective
These are the **my** objectives for this demo application.
* To explore all the features of constraint layout
* Learn and use material design component in the sample app
* Learn and use the new architecture components in the sample app
* Learn and use proper architecture for the app - likely MVVM
* Document everything well so that future external contribution is easier

# ConstraintLayout Demo
> NOTE: This is in planning phase now.

A demo application for Android `ConstraintLayout` with various usage with sample code.

## Proposed App Features
* Have a grid containing different feature set of `ConstraintLayout`
* For each feature, have different examples
* Each example should allow you to share the code snippet or copy to clipboard
* Each example may also contain additional resource links to blog or technical articles
* Example may have set of sliders/toggle to change metrics dynamically to visualize.


### `ConstraintLayout` features to cover 
- [ ] Relative positioning
  * [ ] Horizontal Axis: left, right, start and end sides
  * [ ] Vertical Axis: top, bottom sides and text baseline
- [ ] Margins
- [x] Centering positioning and bias
- [x] Circular positioning _(Added in 1.1)_
- [x] Visibility behavior
- [ ] Dimension constraints
  * [ ] Ratio
  * [ ] Percent dimension
  * [ ] Min and Max
  * [ ] `MATCH_CONSTRAINT` dimensions _(Added in 1.1)_
  * [ ] `WRAP_CONTENT` : enforcing constraints _(Added in 1.1)_
  * [ ] Widgets dimension constraints
- [ ] Chains
  * [ ] Chain Style
  * [ ] Weighted chains
  * [ ] Margins and chains _(Added in 1.1)_
- [ ] Virtual Helpers objects
  * [ ] Guideline
  * [ ] Barrier
  * [ ] Group
- [ ] Optimizer _(Added in 1.1)_

## Objective
These are the **my** objectives for this demo application.
* To explore all the features of constrainst layout
* Learn and use material design component in the sample app
* Learn and use the new architecture components in the sample app
* Learn and use proper architecture for the app - likely MVVM
* Document everything well so that future external contribution is easier

Here is a snapshot of current progress _(This will be updated from time to time)_.
